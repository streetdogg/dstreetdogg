By profession, I am an Embedded Systems, Software Engineer. I am passionate about studying electricity and use that as a way to understand the world around me. How we can make inanimate matter do our bidding is something that has always fascinated me and leaves me in awe every time I think about it.

My other intellectual interests are in the fields of - Humanities, Psychology and Human behavior, Justice, and Education. It's just amazing how far humanity has come and how much it has achieved. I like to ponder on how all of it happened, despite catastrophic events like the World Wars!
