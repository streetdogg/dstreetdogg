By profession, I am an Embedded Systems, Software Engineer. I am passionate about studying electricity and use that as a way to understand the world around me. How we can make inanimate matter do our bidding is something that has always fascinated me and leaves me in awe every time I think about it.

My other intellectual interests are in the fields of - Humanities, Psychology and Human behavior, Justice, and Education. It's just amazing how far humanity has come and how much it has achieved. I like to ponder on how all of it happened, despite catastrophic events like the World Wars!

Lately, I have gone OCD on studying the interaction between Waves and Matter, and Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems. It may not seem obvious but both these topics have given me a very different view of how Nature operates! Here is a snap of the books I am in love with -

My Blog is a collection of notes. These notes include experiences, comments on career development, experiments in Embedded systems development, and random other things that I feel like keeping a record of.

I use writing as a way to slow down my thinking. Usually, the intention is to grab something of worth, something that helps me improve as a human, learn more about how I and the world operate together, or (mostly) a way to correct my model of the world.

I hope you find these helpful.

Thanks for stopping by, \
